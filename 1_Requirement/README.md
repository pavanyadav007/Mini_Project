##Complex Calculator

The project is based on doing acomplex operations in a calculator like tan() of a number. It helps the user quickly find answer of any complex problem like finding square of a huge number. The project being user friendly makes this project very polpular.

##Defining system
   Scientific calculator does following operations:
      1) Square Root
      2) Square of a number
      3) Logarithmic value of a number
      4) Trignometric operations like sin,cos and tan
